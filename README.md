# Probability model misspecification and parameter estimation uncertainty
## Abstract
One of the main steps in probabilistic seismic collapse risk assessment is fitting the fragility function. The widely used maximum likelihood estimation approach for fitting seismic collapse fragility functions contains the underlying assumption that the likelihood function is known to follow a specified parametric probability distribution. However, this assumed distribution may not always be consistent with the “true” probability distribution of the collapse data. This paper implements the Information matrix equivalence theorem to identify the presence of model misspecification i.e., if the assumed collapse probability distribution is, in fact, the “true” one. In presence of model misspecification, the fragility parameter estimates continue to be asymptotically normally distributed but the variance-covariance matrix is no longer equal to the inverse of the Fisher’s Information matrix. To increase the robustness of the variance-covariance matrix, the HuberWhite sandwich estimator is implemented. Using collapse data from eight woodframe buildings, the effect of model misspecification on fragility parameter estimates and collapse rate is quantified. The results show that, while different from the one obtained from Fisher’s Information, the variance-covariance matrix obtained using the “sandwich” estimator did not have a significant effect on the propagation of parameter estimation uncertainty to the collapse rate.
